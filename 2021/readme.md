# Advent of code 2021

This year I have no expectations of reaching far. The purpose of this year is
to tinker and play around with haskell.

Most of the stuff here is not mine, due to lack of knowledge my solutions quite
often ended up being copied from other sources, and I ended up reading
different solutions and then writing my own from those, in a way that made more
sense to me.

## Todo

- Setup stack
- Setup parsing into one file and run each day as a test.
