# Advent of code 2021

This year I have no expectations of reaching far. The purpose of this year was
initially to tinker and play around with haskell. That didn't go as far as I
hoped. This readme in general specifically addresses haskell solutions

Most of the stuff here is not mine, due to lack of knowledge my solutions quite
often ended up being copied from other sources, and I ended up reading
different solutions and then writing my own from those, in a way that made more
sense to me.
